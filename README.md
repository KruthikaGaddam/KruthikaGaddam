# Hi there 👋 I'm Kruthika - Want to know more? Keep Scrolling!

#### Hello folks 👋 I'm Kruthika, a **Dentist turned Data Analyst** with a passion for transforming healthcare data into actionable insights.

📊   Currently, I'm leveraging my analytical skills as a **Data Analyst** at **Indiana University Health**, where I'm focused on driving data-driven improvements in healthcare outcomes.

🌱   On a personal note, I'm currently diving deeper into the fascinating world of **Artificial Intelligence**.

📚   One of my favorite reads is **Atomic Habits** by James Clear.

☕  When I'm not analyzing data, I enjoy Amateur Photography, learning new things, getting lost in a good book, relaxing with a favorite sitcom, taking short walks, and experimenting with cooking.

⏳   I believe in the fascinating concept of **time relativity** – when we're truly passionate about our work or anything we love to do, time seems to fly by unnoticed.
